ðŸš€ Building a Dynamic User Management App with React.js & TailwindCSS

I just built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that efficiently manages user data using React.js for the frontend and TailwindCSS for sleek, responsive styling. Hereâ€™s what it does:

âœ” User-Friendly Form: Collects details like Name, Phone, Email, Address, and State.
âœ” LocalStorage Integration: Saves data in the browserâ€™s localStorage under the key "Users" for persistence.
âœ” Data Display: Fetches and displays stored users in a clean, organized table.
âœ” Edit & Delete Functionality:

Edit: Click the edit icon to open a pre-filled modal and update user details.

Delete: Confirmation modal ensures safe deletion of user data.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

ReactJS (State management, hooks)

TailwindCSS (Styling)

JavaScript ES6+ (LocalStorage operations)

This project was a great way to practice state management, form handling, and localStorage operations while keeping the UI modern and intuitive.
